# Fractal-Image-Comparison-Tool
## Overview
This project provides a tool to compare two images generated by fractal geometry. The algorithm converts the images into binary matrices (where black pixels are represented as `1` and white pixels as `0`), subtracts the matrices based on the position of each pixel, and calculates the total difference. If the total difference is `0`, the images are considered identical in terms of the spatial distribution of black pixels. Otherwise, they are considered different.

The tool also generates a difference image (`difference_image.png`) that visually highlights the differences between the two input images.

## Key Features
- **Binary Conversion**: Converts colored images into binary matrices (black pixels = `1`, white pixels = `0`).
- **Tolerance Adjustment**: Allows adjusting the tolerance for identifying black pixels.
- **Difference Calculation**: Computes the absolute difference between the binary matrices of the two images.
- **Visual Output**: Generates a difference image to visualize discrepancies.
- **Similarity Check**: Determines if the images are identical based on the spatial distribution of black pixels.

## How It Works
1. **Binary Conversion**:
   - Each image is converted into a binary matrix where black pixels are represented as `1` and non-black pixels as `0`.
   - A tolerance value can be adjusted to account for near-black pixels.

2. **Matrix Subtraction**:
   - The binary matrices of the two images are subtracted element-wise.
   - The absolute difference is calculated to ensure positive values.

3. **Difference Calculation**:
   - The total difference is computed by summing all values in the absolute difference matrix.
   - If the total difference is `0`, the images are considered identical.

4. **Visualization**:
   - A difference image is generated to highlight the discrepancies between the two input images.
## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fractal-image-comparison.git
   cd fractal-image-comparison

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
    Pillow
    numpy
You can install them using pip:
pip install pillow numpy

## Usage
1. **Prepare Images**:
    - Place the two images you want to compare in the project directory.
    - Update the image_path1 and image_path2 variables in the script with the paths to your images.
2. **Run the Script**:
   python Main.py
3. **Adjust Tolerance (Optional)**:
   - You can adjust the tolerance_value in the script to account for near-black pixels. For example:
     tolerance_value = 10  # Adjust this value as needed

4. ** View Results**:

    - The script will output:

        - The number of black pixels in each image.

        - The total difference between the two images.

        - Whether the images are identical or different.

    - A difference image (difference_image.png) will be saved in the project directory.
5. ** Example**:

   
 Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the script:
- Example file paths (replace with your actual image file paths)
  
image_path1 = 'image1.png'
image_path2 = 'image2.png'

- Compare the images with a tolerance of 10
compare_images(image_path1, image_path2, tolerance=10)


 Output:
 
Number of black pixels in image1.png with tolerance 10: 1200
Number of black pixels in image2.png with tolerance 10: 1180
Number of differing pixels: 20
Total number of pixels in Image 1: 262144
Number of black pixels in Image 1: 1200
Total number of pixels in Image 2: 262144
Number of black pixels in Image 2: 1180
Total difference in black pixels: 20
The images are different in the spatial distribution of black pixels.
Difference image saved as 'difference_image.png'.


6. ** Code Explanation**:
Key Functions

    1. convert_to_binary(image_path, tolerance):

        Converts an image to a binary matrix.

        Uses a tolerance value to account for near-black pixels.

    2. compare_images(image_path1, image_path2, tolerance):

        Compares two images by converting them to binary matrices and calculating the difference.

        Generates a difference image and outputs the results.
